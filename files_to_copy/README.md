`fastlane` is a tool for iOS and Android developers to automate tedious tasks like generating screenshots, dealing with provisioning profiles and releasing your application.

You define how your process looks like

```ruby
lane :beta do
  increment_build_number
  cocoapods
  match
  deliver
  sh "./customScript.sh"

  slack
end
```

To deploy your app to the App Store you can run
```
fastlane beta
```

## Installation

    sudo gem install fastlane --verbose

Make sure, you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

    xcode-select --install

If you experience slow launch times of fastlane, try running

    gem cleanup

System Requirements: `fastlane` requires Mac OS X or Linux with Ruby 2.0.0 or above.

If you want to take a look at a project, already using `fastlane`, check out the [fastlane-examples](https://github.com/fastlane/examples) with `fastlane` setups by Wikipedia, Product Hunt, MindNode and more.

## Quick Start

The setup assistant will create all the necessary files for you, using the existing app metadata from iTunes Connect.

- ```cd [your_project_folder]```
- ```fastlane init```
- Follow the setup assistant, which will set up ```fastlane``` for you
- Further customise the ```Fastfile``` with [actions](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/docs/Actions.md).

## Available commands

Usually you'll use fastlane by triggering individual lanes:

    fastlane [lane_name]

#### Other commands

- `fastlane actions`: List all available `fastlane` actions
- `fastlane action [action_name]`: Shows a more detailed description of an action
- `fastlane lanes`: Lists all available lanes with description
- `fastlane list`: Lists all available lanes without description
- `fastlane new_action`: Create a new action (integration) for fastlane
